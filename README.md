# Satisfice

Each constraint evaluates to a number between 0.0 and 2.0 or true and false.

Buttons now represent RoomType clusters as well.

Each flag is associated with a list or rooms and buttons.
Each flag computes its own score for the constraint bar based off of the assoicated constraints.

Requires Stanford version of Eclipse (Helios)
